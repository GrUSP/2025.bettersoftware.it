  bio: "Riccardo is a type designer and member of CAST – Cooperativa Anonima Servizi Tipografici. Besides designing, he is doing a PhD at the University of Reading, faculty of Typography and Graphic Design. His research concerns 15th-century Venetian roman types and he combines use of bibliographical knowledge with analysis of letterforms. In 2014 he took an MA in Typeface Design at the University of Reading where he was introduced to so-called non-Latin types and fell in love with Bengali script. Prior to this, from the late 1990s, he freelanced as a type and graphic designer in Milan and elsewhere in northern Italy. From 2009–2013 he was a lecturer in typography at the University of Bolzano. He currently lives between Bolzano and London."
