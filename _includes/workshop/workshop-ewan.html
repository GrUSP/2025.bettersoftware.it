			        <p class="intro">Fluent styles of movement characterize good letterforms, they extend our creativity and encourage the emergence of personal expression.</p>
              <p>In this workshop, suitable for designers of all levels, we will experiment, in a structured way (following in the footsteps of Rudolf Laban), with different movement styles.</p>

             <p>This workshop can work for the relative beginner in calligraphy and for the very experienced. Just as singers exercise their voices to expand their range of notes and tones so we will exercise our pens on the paper. Letters and marks that push, float, glide, flutter. Working initially with abstract pattern and lines we apply these movements to different styles of letterforms, overcoming limited and habitual patterns of movement in the process. You will emerge from this class with a new confidence in your own ability to write and to create personal styles of calligraphy - and with the work to prove it.</p>
             <p>A "Drawing Kit" will be provided. The kit will include a Parallel stroke pen, ink refill, drawing sheets, pencils, thin marker, glue.</p>
